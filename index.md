The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America that draws the attention of many basketball fans all over the world. During the regular season, each of the 30 teams (15 in the Eastern Conference and 15 in the Western Conference) plays 82 games. At the conclusion of the regular season, the top eight teams in each conference advance to the playoffs for a chance to compete for the championship title.

The goal of this project is to build a statistical machine learning model that can predict the regular season winning percentages of the NBA teams in the Western Conference, and thus the playoff teams.
We hope our analysis will lead to meaningful insights that will be of interest to NBA fans and NBA data analysts all over the world.
