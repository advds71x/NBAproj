<p>We will demonstrate several interesting plots.</p>

		<h3>Team-Level: Team Points vs Opponent Points</h3>
		<span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/team_def_off_plot.png" alt="" /></span>
		<p>
		We explored how team offense and defense were related to conference standings. Some highly ranked teams are strong both offensively and defensively (e.g. TOR), while some teams make up for their weaker offense through strong defense (e.g. IND).</p>

	<div class="4u 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Team-Level: Season Rank vs First 20 Games Rank</h3>
		<span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/team_rank_plot.png" alt="" /></span>
		<p>We next explored how the team standings after 20 regular games compared to the final standings at the end of the regular season. Many teams that performed well in the beginning of the regular season continued to perform well throughout the season (e.g. GSW &amp; DEN), while some teams that were not faring well earlier on finished the season strong (e.g. HOU &amp; UTA), and still other teams that were in the top 8 after 20 regular season games did not make it to the playoffs in the end (e.g. MEM &amp; LAL). </p>

	<div class="4u$ 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Team-Level: Season Win vs First 20 Games Win</h3>
		<span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/team_win_plot.png" alt="" /></span>
		<p>The line shows the expected number of regular season wins if teams were to maintain the same first-20-game-winning-percentage throughout the regular season. Some teams had a consistent performance throughout the season (e.g. MIN &amp; OKC), while other teams had better (e.g. HOU) or worse (e.g. MEM) performance in the remaining 62 games. </p>
